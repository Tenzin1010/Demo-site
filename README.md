# Demo-site 
### The site is responsive and utilizes approx 80% semantics
  #### sections stack when viewport is minimized. 
  #### The site is pretty standard with Header, main content and a footer. I've used only HTML & CSS to create it as practice

#### Utilized CSS floats, position in place of flex box. 

#### Created it with 3 pages, most of the content & sytling are shared between the pages

#### Standard 3 color scheme is used.
